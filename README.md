# bike_and_python_skills
I created this project as a way to pratice what I had learned so far in Python
I presented it at the end of my lightning talk about bikes and bike riding as a lighthearted way to show that things can go wrong quickly if you don't take the time to master the small skills before moving onto the larger skills - a timely reminder in our coding journeys!
